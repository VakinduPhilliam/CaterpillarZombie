# Caterpillar Zombie:

Caterpillar Zombie is a invasion game where players defend their fruits from invading zombie caterpillars.

The game turns in progress bitbucket project issues, open pull requests, and active alerts into an invading army of caterpillar zombies to defeat.

The larger the number of unresolved bitbucket project issues get, the longer the Caterpillar Zombies get and the fewer the number of unresolved bitbucket project issues get, the shorter the Caterpillar Zombies get.
